Problem Statement: - 

In small or old libraries it is difficult to maintain the record of the list of books, their borrow history, user record and several other things. In order to solve that I have created a Library Management System whose main role is to make all these features automatic, fast as well as efficient. It is made to make things simple for everyone.

Scope of the Project: - 

Currently the project is built at a small level. However here are some plans to scale this project in the future:

1.)	 The system can be upgraded and a graphical user interface(GUI) can be added.

2.)	Cloud Based storage can also be added as in the future the data will increase a lot.
3.)	Advance search options can also be added in the program and several algorithms can be used to suggest new books to the user based on their preferences.

4.)	Features such as feedback collection, different languages support, more strict access controls and adding more intense features.

5.)	Also, those features can be added where support for mobile applications are also enabled.

These additions will of course make my system better and make it better performing.

Target Users: - 

The main target audience for this project are the librarians and the people who often visit a library. With this way they can keep a track of numerous things such as viewing the list of books, adding a book, showing the users list and many other features. It is for anyone irrespective of their age, colour, gender. So, the entire book reading audience is the target audience.

High Level Features: - 

A few of the high level features of the project are: 

•	Three major modules: -  I have used os module along with json module and datetime module as well

•	Clear Input / Output Structures: -

 In my programs very easily a user can enter the input and will also get the desired output.
For Example – You have several options, a total of 10 to 11 from where you can select and random one and get the desired output.

•	Other things such as Book Management where one can view all the books or check their availability or even trap top 5 books as well. For user, he can add another user, see the registered users list already, borrow books as well as return a book and also check the view borrowed list. 

•	Along with that an Overdue Report which generates a report of the list of all transactions is available. The data is saved properly showing data persistence and along with that reminders are also displayed where the system reminds the user as to return the book.

•	Logical Workflow Overview: -

 In my project, once the commands are run the Library object loads the already present data via library_data.json file. Based on that, the user is presented a menu with 10 options giving many features. User can select any one of them like list all books, etc, if any input is required then it will be asked and then the later methods will be applied and based on the logic the output will be displayed. After this, as everything is in loop again the options will be presented until option 10 is selected which is “Save and Exit Operation”.
